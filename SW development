*Development of new internal Tool*

Usually, there are initiatives to collect new improvement or innovation ideas within our company.
Out of these ideas, Innovation Backlog is created.
Sponsor chooses based on funding possibilities and priority, often the most desired ideas are chosen based on voting.
Ideas divided into – Essential, Good-to have, Declined
Essential ideas are then “brought into life”.
Transformation team is responsible for development of the software as a way to implement the IDEA, based on the initial IDEA submission.
A team leader/product owner and often also Agile coach is appointed, required amount of developers is appointed.    
The person/team who submitted the IDEA is contacted to provide specifications of the IDEA, requirements and features. 
Developer(s) together with Team leader and Agile coach create Project Backlog based of the basic requirements, user stories and features.
Sprints are weekly and Github, Slack and Mural are mostly used as project development management tools. 
Development team is reporting to Sponsor on a weekly basis at the end of each Sprint regarding the budget consumption and progress.
Team huddles take place every morning, where all committed teammembers discuss thir progress, limitations and request any help needed.
The decision-making process is solely within the development/transformation team.
Once MVP is developed, the idea creator(s) and other teams that will be using the software/tool are involved into the testing and they are 
asked to provide feedback. After 1-2 weeks of iterations, tool is launched on Testing server and the testing continues. 
The definition of done is based on deadline and budget determined by sponsor, which means that not all improvement suggestions/adjustments 
in form of user stories are implemented. 
Once the deadline is reached, the software is moved to production. Each feature that is implemented based on user stories is the increment.
